When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I want to share my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	I have no idea. Autosync could be awesome feature if it would properly implemented.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Fork for git exists only on github. I can use fork to clone github repository when I don't have permission to contribute to existing repository.
	Clone creates cope of existing repository and I can sync clones with push and pull commands.
	Branch is logical part of repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	If I have latest copy, the next time I pull changes it will be fast-forward merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	I would use emails. It would be much harder for complex changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	If I'm not sure if my work is completed, I probably want to create separate branch. In this case I can be sure that master branch is always in stable state.
